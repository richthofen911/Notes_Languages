::How Scala’s == differs from Java’s
    In Java, you can use == to compare both primitive and reference types.
    On primitive types, Java’s == compares value equality, as in Scala. On reference types, however, 
    Java’s == compares reference equality, which means the two variables point to the same object on the JVM’s heap.
    Scala provides a facility for comparing reference equality, as well, under the name eq. However, eq and its 
    opposite, ne, only apply to objects that directly map to Java objects. The full details about eq and ne are given
    in Sections 11.1 and 11.2. Also, see Chapter 30 on how to write a good equals method.
